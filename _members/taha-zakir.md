 I am a BS-CS graduate from the Lahore University of Management Sciences, currently working on the Super Abbu project under Professor Mustafa's mentorship. I am passionate about designing and developing technologies for equity and accessibility. I am a big fan of soup, weird fiction, and Brentford Football Club.
