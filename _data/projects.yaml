  description: Empathy is a cornerstone of effective doctor-patient communication,
paramount in healthcare for understanding and sharing the feelings of
others. The depth of this empathetic connection can significantly
influence patient outcomes, underscoring empathy's role in fostering
trust and ensuring patient-centered care. However, the assessment of
clinician empathy often employs Western-centric methodologies, which
may not accurately capture the empathetic capabilities of clinicians
in diverse cultural contexts. Such a discrepancy can lead to
misunderstandings, with clinicians potentially perceived as less
empathetic when evaluated against a cultural benchmark that does not
align with their or their patients' cultural norms. Our research
proposes a method that aligns clinician-expressed empathy—what
clinicians believe they are conveying—with patient-expected empathy,
shaped by their cultural background. By examining the interplay
between how empathy is expressed by clinicians and expected by
patients within their cultural context, our research aims to explore:
Does incorporating patient expectations into the measurement of
clinician empathy in healthcare enhance its accuracy and ensure it
more accurately reflects the nuanced dynamics of patient-clinician
interactions across various cultural settings?
