  description: "Empathy is a cornerstone of effective doctor-patient communication,\
    \ paramount in healthcare for understanding and sharing the feelings of\
    \ others. The depth of this empathetic connection can significantly\
    \ influence patient outcomes, underscoring empathy''s role in fostering\
    \ trust and ensuring patient-centered care. However, the assessment of\
    \ clinician empathy often employs Western-centric methodologies, which\
    \ may not accurately capture the empathetic capabilities of clinicians\
    \ in diverse cultural contexts. Such a discrepancy can lead to\
    \ misunderstandings, with clinicians potentially perceived as less\
    \ empathetic when evaluated against a cultural benchmark that does not\
    \ align with their or their patient''s cultural norms. Our research\
    \ proposes a method that aligns clinician-expressed empathy what clinicians believe they are conveying with\
    \ patient expected empathy,shaped by their cultural background. By examining the interplay\
    \ between how empathy is expressed by clinicians and expected by patients within their cultural context,\ 
    \ our research aims to explore: Does incorporating patient expectations into the measurement of\
    \ clinician empathy in healthcare enhance its accuracy and ensure it more accurately reflects the nuanced \
    \ dynamics of patient-clinician interactions across various cultural settings?"
